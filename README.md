# CICD-project
This project sets up a CI/CD pipeline on AWS for Linux-based applications. It uses CodeCommit for source control, CodeBuild for building and testing, and CodePipeline to automate the workflow. The application is deployed on an EC2 Linux server, with CloudWatch handling monitoring/logging and SNS sending notifications.
